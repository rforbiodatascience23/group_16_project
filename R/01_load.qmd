# Loading the data

After selecting our dataset, we loaded and saved it into our data repository. This pivotal step sets the foundation for our analysis, allowing us to explore and draw insights from the abundance of information within the dataset.

1.  Load in all important library's

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)

```

2.  Afterward, we read the dataset 'processed.cleveland.data' from the directory '\_raw' and store it in the variable 'data'. The '\_raw' repository contains all the raw files we uploaded from our chosen dataset.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("../_raw/processed.cleveland.data",header = FALSE)
```

3.  Then we write the contents of the data to a TSV file into the data directory.

```{r}
readr::write_tsv(data, "../data/01_dat_load.tsv")
```
